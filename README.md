# Star Wars Planets API
A simple REST API to consult the start wars planets 

## Getting started

### Install docker
To turn our lives easier we going to use `docker` and `docker-compose` to generate a mongodb database container. Click [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/) to install docker and run `make setup` to start our containers.

### Install Golang
We also have [a bash script](https://github.com/canha/golang-tools-install-script/blob/master/goinstall.sh) to install Golang

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/canha/golang-tools-install-script/master/goinstall.sh # Download it
./goinstall.sh # Install it
```
